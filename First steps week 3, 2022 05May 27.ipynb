    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. All of one type.\n",
    "2. Unchanging in size from when it was first created.\n",
    "\n",

    "Do we have arrays in Python?  Do we need arrays in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "And the answer is... there is an \"array\" type in Python, but it's used so rarely that it'll soon be removed from the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of data science, we use NumPy and Pandas, two add-on extension packages.  These define arrays that are *very* popular.  But they're not core to the language."
