    "# What about arrays?\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is a data structure in many different programming languages.  It is an ordered collection, often with an index starting at 0.  (Sometimes, in some languages, it starts with 1, but that's not important.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, are lists arrays?  The answer is: No.  Why not?  Because by definition, an array is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All of one type.\n",
    "2. Unchanging in size from when it was first created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists violate both of these rules, so they aren't arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do we have arrays in Python?  Do we need arrays in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "And the answer is... there is an \"array\" type in Python, but it's used so rarely that it'll soon be removed from the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of data science, we use NumPy and Pandas, two add-on extension packages.  These define arrays that are *very* popular.  But they're not core to the language."
